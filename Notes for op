Net Recon Methodology

    Host Discovery
        Ruby ping sweep (if ping available)
        Nmap scan if no ping
    Port Discovery
        nmap
        nc scan script
    Port Validation
        Banner grabbing using nc
    Follow-on actions based on ports found
        if 21 FTP [IP ADDR] connects to ftp server
        if 21 or 80 wget -r IP_ADDRESS (or) wget -r ftp://IP_ADDRESS (or) firefox
            passive
            Is
            get [file name]
        if 22 or 23 CONNECT and PASSIVE RECON

Scan Methodology
    nmap -Pn [IP Addr] -T4 -p 21-23,80

    Quick Scan Ports 21-23,80
    Specific ports based on hints/clues found
    Well known port range
        0 - 1023 (Actually scan 1-1023)
    Chunks of 2000 or first 10000 ports (65535)

Passive Recon Methodology

    Hostname
        hostname
    Permissions:
        sudo -l (What are my permissions?)
    Interfaces and subnets
        ip a
    Neighbors
        ip neigh
    Files of interest
        find / -iname flag* 2>/dev/null
        find / -iname hint*
    Other listening ports
        ss -ntlp ("ss -nult" for UDP ports)
    Available Tools
        which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet get curl ping (if a command requires sudo it wont appear unless which is run with sudo)
