Net Recon Methodology

    Host Discovery
        Ruby ping sweep (if ping available)
        Nmap scan if no ping
    Port Discovery
        nmap
        nc scan script
    Port Validation
        Banner grabbing using nc
    Follow-on actions based on ports found
        if 21 FTP [IP ADDR] connects to ftp server
        if 21 or 80 wget -r IP_ADDRESS (or) wget -r ftp://IP_ADDRESS (or) firefox
            passive
            Is
            get [file name]
        if 22 or 23 CONNECT and PASSIVE RECON

Scan Methodology
    nmap -Pn [IP Addr] -T4 -p 21-23,80

    Quick Scan Ports 21-23,80
    Specific ports based on hints/clues found
    Well known port range
        0 - 1023 (Actually scan 1-1023)
    Chunks of 2000 or first 10000 ports (65535)

Passive Recon Methodology

    Hostname
        hostname
    Permissions:
        sudo -l (What are my permissions?)
    Interfaces and subnets
        ip a
    Neighbors
        ip neigh
    Files of interest
        find / -iname flag* 2>/dev/null
        find / -iname hint*
    Other listening ports
        ss -ntlp ("ss -nult" for UDP ports)
    Available Tools
        which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet get curl ping (if a command requires sudo it wont appear unless which is run with sudo)


use -X when ssh to use eom on pngs







Task 1 Netcat Relay

Objective: You have been provided intel in regards to colecting key intelligence and sensitive data from Donovian Cyberspace, move and redirect all data back to your INTERNET-HOST. A Donovian Insider has stashed important information in the form of JPG images on T2. Each JPG image contains a piece of the message in the form of Steganography. Utilizing Netcat relays, you will use the designated RELAY to transfer the JPG images to your INTERNET-HOST. Once the images are downloaded you will use a command-line tool called steghide to extract the message.

Utilize the targets T1, T2, and RELAY to develop the following netcat relays for use by Gorgan Cyber Forces. The use of names pipes should be utilized on RELAY:

    The Donovian Insider provided a image called 1steg.jpg on T2 and is trying to connect to RELAY on TCP port 1234 to send the file. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.

    The Donovian Insider provided a image called 2steg.jpg on T2 and is trying to connect to RELAY on TCP port 4321 to send the file. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to accept this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.

    The Donovian Insider provided a image called 3steg.jpg on T2 listening for a connection from RELAY on TCP port 6789. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to make this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.

    The Donovian Insider provided a image called 4steg.jpg on T2 listening for a connection from RELAY on TCP port 9876. Establish a Netcat relay on RELAY to make this connection and forward to T1. Use steghide to deode the message. Perform an MD5SUM on this message.

    Use the syntax: steghide extract -sf [image name] to extract the hidden message. Use password when prompted for a passphrase.
