***Windows Boot Process***

Get-Content C:\Windows\Panther\Setupact.log | Select-String "Detected boot environment"     #Shows your boot manager

smss.exe - Starts the kernel and user mode sub systems

4.2.1 User Subsystem Session 0

Session 0 is for security and high privilege processes such as services. They are run in a separate session to isolate them from individual user’s processes.

    smss.exe installs the Win32 subsystem kernel and user mode components (win32k.sys - kernel; winsrv.dll - user; and csrss.exe - user.)

        csrss.exe - The Client/Server Runtime Subsystem supports process / thread creation and management.

        wininit.exe marks itself as critical, initializes the Windows temp directory, loads the rest of the registry, and starts user mode scheduling. It also installs programs that require a reboot to finish the install process. It also starts:

            lsm.exe - the Local Session Manager (LSM) handles all sessions of a system (both remote desktop sessions and local system sessions.)

            lsass.exe - the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) provides user authentication services, manages the local security policy, and generates access tokens.

            services.exe the Services Control Manager (SCM) loads AutoStart services, using LSASS to authenticate if they run as something other than System.

        wininit.exe then waits for system shutdown to undo everything it started.



By why does any of this matter?

    Processes in User Subsystem Session 0 are created using the highest permissions available to a User in Windows - SYSTEM

        System has more permissions than an administrative account

        represents the Windows Operating System

        *Can be tricked into executing malicious commands via services

reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services | findstr Spooler     #Showing the Service Control Manager registry key

***Linux Boot Process***

The /etc/environment file sets Global Variables     #Persistance

/etc/profile is a script that executes whenever a user logs into an interactive shell on Linux     #Persistance

/etc/inittab    #Is the location os SysV

dd if=/home/bombadil/mbroken of=/tmp/pridemonth bs=1 count=16 skip=446     
md5sum pridemonth     #output file and get md5sum

cat /etc/inittab     #shows run level

Run levels 2,3,4,5 start the daemon allowing for ssh connection

/sbin is where symbollic links are found

/lib/systemd/system     #path to default target, confirm with systemctl get-default

less graphical.target     #shows config file for Systemd target

systemctl show --property=Wants --value $(systemctl get-default)     #shows actually recognised dependancies for target

systemctl --type=service | grep log     #Shows logging service on linux device

*** Process Validity ***
LOOK AT SERVICES FOR PERSISTANCE

Why check DLLs?
-Are they valid? Did they come from the application?

View an instance of all Win32 (system) services.

    Get-Ciminstance Win32_service | Select Name, Processid, Pathname | more

        Pipe in ft -wrap to see full file name/path



Display modules/dlls associated to a specific process.

    tasklist /m /fi "IMAGENAME eq chrome.exe"



Formating options (If no powershell)

     tasklist /fo:{table|list|csv}`



Filtering for specific string/process

    tasklist /fi "IMAGENAME eq lsass.exe"



 Q: Which Windows commands let us view information on services?

     In Powershell:

          Get-Ciminstance - Microsoft Reference

           Get-Service - Microsoft Reference

      In Command Prompt:

          net start - Shows currently running services

           sc query - Microsoft Reference

PS

View all services.

    Get-service



View a defined service, showing all properties in list format.

    get-service ALG | format-list *



 View only currently running services.

     Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}

CLI

View Services

    sc query



View extended information for all services.

    sc queryex type=service



View extended information for all inactive services.

    sc queryex type=service state=inactive


Scheduled tasks 
PS

View all properties of the first scheduled task.

    Get-ScheduledTask | Select * | select -First 1

CLI

schtasks /query /tn "IchBinBosh" /v /fo list


View Network Connections 

PS

Show all Connections in the "Established" state.

    Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established

CLI

Show netstat help and point out the following:

    netstat /?

Displays all TCP/UDP connections with ports in numerical form with PID and executable associated to the connections

    netstat -anob | more
